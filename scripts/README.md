# Installation Scripts

This directory contains scripts to help users easily install go-polars with precompiled binaries.

## Scripts Overview

### `setup.sh` - Complete Project Setup (Recommended)

The complete setup script that handles everything needed to get go-polars working in your project.

**Usage:**
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jordandelbar/go-polars/main/scripts/setup.sh | sh
```

**What it does:**
- Downloads the polars Go package files to your project
- Downloads the precompiled binary for your platform
- Sets up Go module with proper replace directives
- Creates an example file to test the installation
- Handles all dependencies and configuration

**Options:**
- `--version VERSION` - Install specific version (default: v0.0.22)
- `--force` - Force reinstall even if already set up
- `--skip-verify` - Skip checksum verification
- `--help, -h` - Show help message

**Requirements:**
- Linux x86_64 (other platforms need to build from source)
- Run from your Go project root directory
- curl, sha256sum (for verification)

### `install.sh` - Binary-Only Installation

Downloads only the precompiled binary to your current project.

**Usage:**
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jordandelbar/go-polars/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

**What it does:**
- Downloads the precompiled static library
- Verifies checksums
- Installs to `polars/bin/libpolars_go.a`
- Provides setup instructions

**Options:**
- Same as `setup.sh`

**Use this when:**
- You already have the polars package files
- You only need to update/install the binary
- You want more control over the setup process

## Platform Support

Currently, precompiled binaries are available for:
- âœ… Linux x86_64

For other platforms, you'll need to build from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jordandelbar/go-polars.git
cd go-polars
./build.sh
```

## Security & Verification

All precompiled binaries include SHA256 checksums for verification:

```bash
# Manual verification
sha256sum -c libpolars_go-linux-amd64-v0.0.22.a.sha256
```

The scripts automatically verify checksums unless `--skip-verify` is used.

## Examples

### Quick Start for New Project
```bash
mkdir my-polars-project
cd my-polars-project
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jordandelbar/go-polars/main/scripts/setup.sh | sh
go run example.go
```

### Install Specific Version
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jordandelbar/go-polars/main/scripts/setup.sh | sh -s -- --version v0.0.21
```

### Force Reinstall
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jordandelbar/go-polars/main/scripts/setup.sh | sh -s -- --force
```

### Binary Only (for existing projects)
```bash
cd my-existing-project
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jordandelbar/go-polars/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Checksum verification failed"
- Try with `--skip-verify` flag (not recommended for production)
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the release exists on GitHub

### "Unsupported platform"
- Build from source using `./build.sh`
- Check the [releases page](https://github.com/jordandelbar/go-polars/releases) for available platforms

### "Module not found" errors
- Ensure you're in your Go project directory
- Check that `go.mod` has the correct replace directive
- Run `go mod tidy`

### Permission errors
- Ensure you have write permissions in the current directory
- Don't run with sudo (not needed and not recommended)

## Contributing

To add support for new platforms:
1. Update the platform detection in both scripts
2. Ensure releases include binaries for the new platform
3. Test the installation process
4. Update documentation
